# About Me
Hi, my name is Ben, and I'm a programmer from the UK. I enjoy programming mostly in Python, but also in C# with 
Unity to create different games. I am currently 13, but started programming a few years ago and since then I have 
created a variety of small projects. Currently, I am mostly making API wrappers and some other things.

# Hobbies
I also enjoy VFX(Visual Effects) and play grade 4 piano.

# Current Projects
My most recent project is '[rainbowtables](https://github.com/justbennnn/rainbowtables "")' - a library where the user can create their own rainbowtable.
